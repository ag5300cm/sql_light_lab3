#So far, we have been using Pythonâ€™s string formatting method to insert parameters like table
#and column names into the c.execute() functions. This is fine if we just want to use the
# database for ourselves. However, this leaves our database vulnerable to injection attacks.
#  For example, if our database would be part of a web application, it would allow hackers
# to directly communicate with the database in order to bypass login and password verification
# and steal data.
#In order to prevent this, it is recommended to use ? place holders in the SQLite commands
#  instead of the % formatting expression or the .format() method, which we have been using
# in this tutorial. For example, instead of using

import sqlite3

sqlite_file = 'my_first_db.sqlite'    # name of the sqlite database file
table_name = 'my_table_2'   # name of the table to be queried
id_column = 'my_1st_column'
some_id = 123456
column_2 = 'my_2nd_column'
column_3 = 'my_3rd_column'

# Connecting to the database file
conn = sqlite3.connect(sqlite_file)
c = conn.cursor()


# 5) Check if a certain ID exists and print its column contents
c.execute("SELECT * FROM {tn} WHERE {idf}={my_id}".\
        format(tn=table_name, cn=column_2, idf=id_column, my_id=some_id))

#in the Querying the database - Selecting rows section above, we would want to use the ?
# placeholder for the queried column value and include the variable(s) (here: 123456),
# which we want to insert, as tuple at the end of the c.execute() string.

# 5) Check if a certain ID exists and print its column contents
c.execute("SELECT * FROM {tn} WHERE {idf}=?".\
        format(tn=table_name, cn=column_2, idf=id_column), (123456,))

#However, the problem with this approach is that it would only work for values,
#  not for column or table names. So what are we supposed to do with the rest of the
# string if we want to protect ourselves from injection attacks? The easy solution
#  would be to refrain from using variables in SQLite queries whenever possible,
# and if it cannot be avoided, we would want to use a function that strips all
#  non-alphanumerical characters from the stored content of the variable, e.g.,

def clean_name(some_var):
    return ''.join(char for char in some_var if char.isalnum())
